    <h2> <strong> About me</strong></h2>

    <p>Hi, My name is Jyothish. You can call me jyo too.<br>Welcome to my website.  </p>

    
    <p>Im a highschool graduate now studying Game Programming. The main reason for me to select this course is because i love playing games. I wanna bring the fun and happiness i got while playing games <br>
    to other people too. The moment i played my first Assassin's creed game, I decided that i wanted to be a part of the gaming industry. So i decide to start learning coding and started researching about all the<br>
    process that happen behind the game creation process.  </p>
